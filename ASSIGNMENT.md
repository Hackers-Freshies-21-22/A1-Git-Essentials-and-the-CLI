 - Stepwise commit after running each terminal command, Commit message can be the command you ran
 - Create a README.md on master branch
 - Merge the new branch back onto main and resolve any conflicts

### 2. Bashcrawling ðŸ‘¾

 - Create branch `bash` 
 - Git clone bashcrawl into a separate project folder
 - Add contents of /bashcrawl into the `bash` branch
 - Checkout README (essentially cd entrance, cat scroll, and begin the game)
 - Play the game
 - List out which treasures you found
 - Commit and push this branch
 - NOTE: Do not try to finish the game. I too am unsure as to how big it is. I recommend spending around ~30 mins exploring and learning as much as possible

   `git clone https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl.git bashcrawl`

### 3. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

 - Include a screenshot of your high score in [command-line-heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/bash/index.html?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7nAAG)!

### Optional

This is super optionalâ€¦ legitâ€¦ you wonâ€™t secretly win our hearts if you do this :)

This section assumes level 1 has been completed and the folder structure is fixed. 

This project is actually a React application, the default base that comes with create-react-app (google it). 
Once you have node and npm installed on your machine, you can just run `npm start` on the terminal and a chrome tab will pop up and this application runs locally on your machine. A default React page will be shown. 

The challenge is to change this default page to a 404 error page. A basic 404 will do, but a cool design would be nice. A super giveaway hint: changes will mostly be required only in `src/App.js`

You can read up on React to get an overview of whatâ€™s going on. You will need some basic HTML and CSS skills to make the 404 page. Good luck!
